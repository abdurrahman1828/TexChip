This repository includes the implementation of the manuscript **"Texture Feature-Based Wood Chip Moisture Content Class Prediction."**


## Files & Directories

- ```main.py``` can be directly used to generate results.
- ``utils.py`` includes the required utility functions for running other codes.
- ``RF_with_LIME.py`` file containes the code to generate explanations of the predictions generated by Random Forest model using LIME explainer.
- ```results``` folder will contain the saved results. It also contain codes to summarize results and generate plots.

- ```data``` folder contains pre-extracted Haralick features from two datasets. This study 
was conducted on two datasets using k-fold cross validation. Therefore, train means all ``k-1`` folds and test means the remaining one fold.
