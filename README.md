**Interpretable Wood Chip Moisture Content Prediction through Texture Analysis**


## Files & Directories

- ```main.py``` can be directly used to generate results.
- ``utils.py`` includes the required utility functions for running other codes.
- The ``RF_with_LIME.py`` file contains the code to generate explanations of the predictions generated by the Random Forest model using LIME explainer.
- The `results``` folder will contain the saved results. It also includes codes to summarize results and generate plots.

- The ```data``` folder contains pre-extracted Haralick features from two datasets. This study 
was conducted on two datasets using k-fold cross-validation. Therefore, train means all ``k-1`` folds, and test means the remaining one fold.
